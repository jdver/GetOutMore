Project Description: Our project is going to allow users to search for Meetup events happening nearby in the next 48 hours (possibly 24). Our project aims to encourage users to get out of their house and engage in activities and events. This project is targeted to an age-range from young-adult to older adults, in urban environments/locales, and can be used for a variety of reasons specific to the user, but ultimately, the overarching aim is to be a resource for people who may be wanting to do something in the moment to do it.


We will be using the below API’s:
Meetup: Search query for local events
Weather: Based on event location, weather displays with some type of memo such as (“Don’t forget your umbrella!” if it’s raining)
Spotify: We will potentially add a “mood menu” option, that depending on the user’s mood selection, will play a song tied to that genre.
